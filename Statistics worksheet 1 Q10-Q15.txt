Statistics worksheet 1 : Q10-Q15

Q10 : What do you understand by the term Normal Distribution?
===>  - A normal distribution is always shows in bell curve.
      - In normal distribution, mean=0 and standard deviation=1	
      - In this, skweness is zero in both side.
      - Normal distributions are symmetrical.
      - In normal distribution,the mean, mode and median are all equal.

Q11 : How do you handle missing data? What imputation techniques do you recommend?
===> How do you handle missing data? 
    ---------------------------------
There are multiple ways of handling the missing data, few are as follows : 
1. Mean replacement : Replace missing values by mean.
		      It Works easy n fast
		      It won't affect the mean and sample size of entire dataset.
Disadvanteges : It won't work on categorical data.
	        It only works on column level,therefore misses correlation between features.
   		It would not be very accurate.
		
2. Dropping : Drop the unwanted data column or row
    	      It works best, if we work on huge dataset where dropping a unwanted column.
              We just need to make sure that dropping row doesn't bias the dataset.
Disadvanteges : It never going to be the right answer for the best approach. 
 	        Because, we may see the realtionship of every feature.
                So, It may affect the accuracy. 

	What imputation techniques do you recommend?
      -----------------------------------------------
To overcome above drawbacks there are some imputation techniques which works best, few are as follows :
1. KNN : It find K-nearest row and average their values.
	 It works on numeriacal data by using euclidean distance.
         It also works on categorical data by using Hamming distance.
  But, KNN works best on numerical data.

2. Deep learning : It works well on categorical data.But it's complicated. because a lot of code involved.

3.Multiple regression : Find the linear and non-linear relationship between feature and other features.

Q12 : What is A/B testing?
===> - A/B Tesing is basically used to compare two different products.
     - Those comparision done on the basis of user input.
Let's take an example of e-commerce site
In Youtube, If suppose I'm watching a data science cource video(which one is best?). At the same time, there are adds pop-up or some thumbnails are their, if suppose I click on any add or other suggected video over there. If I search on th course again on other website, the same adds might pop-up again.And suppose I again go for Youtube look for something else this adds pop-up again because last time I clicked on it.
How this happens?
Due to A/B testing.Because many organization prefers this. Here we can get the customer analysis that this perticular type of cuatomer click on this perticular adds, which will get saved at the back-end.
Advantages : 
1. It gives the data analysis very well to identify that what kind of cuatomers like what about perticular topic which user was searching for.
2. It will get easy for user to search because no need to search again because of popping-up of same add again.

This is the concept of A/B testing.

Q13 : Is mean imputation of missing data acceptable practice?
===> Mean replacement : Replace missing values by mean.
		      It Works easy n fast
		      It won't affect the mean and sample size of entire dataset.
Disadvanteges : It won't work on categorical data.
	        It only works on column level,therefore misses correlation between features.
   		It would not be very accurate.

Q14 : What is linear regression in statistics?
===>    - Linear regression is a type of predictive analysis.
	- It predict the outcome of dependent variable on the bases of independent variable.
	- It plots a best fit line for analysis on the bases of y=mx+c
 How to	plot best fit line ?
----------------------------
Let's plot the datapoints in  graph of x-axis and y-axis.
Here, the line plots on the bases of intercept and coefficient.

What is intercept and coefficent?
line equation : y=mx+c
where m=coefficient
      c=intercept

if x=1 then then y^=1  where y^=mx+c(equation for predicted line)
but if m=1 then cost function=0 then I've to change m=0.5 and plot a line again(analyse by scaling starts from 0.5 on both x&y axis)
So there is a cost function which gives the predicted points.I'll try to find out the cost value when my m=0.5 then cost function=0.58
Cost function=1/2m summation of i=1 to m (y^-y)^2
-------------------------------------------------
The line plots by calculating the differece between the each n every actual data point with the predicted data point.
and the m & c gives the coefficient and intercept.
Intercept tells that where to start plotting the line 
Coefficient gives the angle which means at which angle have to extend the best fit line.

In this the way the linear regression works.

Q15 : What are the various branches of statistics
===> It is attached in jupyter file. Kidly see this for Q15.
